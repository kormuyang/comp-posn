# POSN

Hi everyone! This repo was intentionally made as a guideline for competing in POSN.
<br><br>

## Roadmap

This is the rough roadmap showing what you need to do.

1. Master the Language (C/C++)
2. Understand Analysis of Algorithms
3. [Learn Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)](#curriculum-dsa)
4. Practice Problems
5. Compete in Online Contests
<br>

## Curriculum: DSA

This is the most significant part because DSA is the main material taught in the camp.

### Part: Data Structures

The following table shows all the course materials for data structures, listed in the order they should be completed.

| 2 | Linked List | |
| 3 | Stack, Queue, & Deque | |
| 4 | Hashing (Hash Tables) | |
| 5 | Tree | |
| 6 | Binary Search Tree (BST) | |
