# POSN

Hi everyone! This repo was intentionally made as a guideline for competing in POSN.

## Roadmap

This is the rough roadmap showing what you need to do.

1. Master the Language (C/C++)
2. Understand Analysis of Algorithms
3. Learn Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
4. Practice Problems
5. Compete in Online Contests

## Curriculum: DSA

This is the most significant part because DSA is the main material taught in the camp.

### Part: Data Structures

1. Array
2. Linked List
3. Stack, Queue, & Deque
4. Hashing (Hash Tables)
5. Tree
6. Binary Search Tree (BST)
7. Heap (Priority Queue)
8. Trie
9. Graph
10. Disjoint Set Union (DSU)
11. Segment Tree & Fenwick Tree

### Part: Algorihms

1. Mathematics
2. Bitwise Algorithms
3. Recursion
4. Searching
5. Sorting
6. Hashing
7. String Algorithms
8. Greedy Algortihms
9. Backtracking
10. Dynamic Programming (DP)
